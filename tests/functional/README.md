# Functional Tests

## Usage
- All tests should be placed here in a sub-directory.
- The `run_functional.py` script (one-level up) will run the tests for every sub-directory.
- Each sub-directory **must contain:**
  - `config.yaml`: The LUTE configuration YAML for this test. **It must have a specific** `experiment` **and** `run` defined in the LUTE header.
  - `dag.yaml`: The workflow definition YAML for this test.
- Each sub-directory may also contain:
  - `SHOULD_FAIL`: An empty file indicating the workflow is intended to return a failure status.
  - `README.md`: An explanatory README for the test.

## SFX tests: what they need deployed

- Geometries and cells are read from `/sdf/group/lcls/ds/tools/lute/test_utilities/sfx/`. The copies
  committed in each test directory are the source to deploy there.
- The GLINT tests run GLINT from `/sdf/group/lcls/ds/tools/glint/lute/glint_launch.sh` (`executable`
  in each config). GLINT is not bundled with LUTE, so `IndexGLINT` has no default `executable`; that
  path needs a GLINT checkout. Its indexing step runs on ampere, so a run_functional.py `--account`
  must be valid there.

## SFX tests: what counts as a pass

- The merged SFX tests come in pairs on the same run and events (r194 and r51, CrystFEL and GLINT). A
  pair passes when both workflows complete and the GLINT test's merged overall CC1/2 is at least the
  CrystFEL test's. Crystal counts are reported, not thresholded. run_functional.py checks only
  completion; the CC1/2 are read from the CompareHKL logs by hand. (An absolute bar of CC1/2 > 0.3 with
  ~100 crystals was dropped: the GLINT handoff on all 17,872 events of r51 merged 242 crystals at 0.175.)
- The indexing rates quoted in the test READMEs come from the beamline's cctbx or the users' CrystFEL
  runs. They are floors, not targets: the peak lists here include crystals those runs did not index.
  A test that indexes far MORE than the floor has to be justified by its merge, not by the count.
- mfxl1038923 r58 (no cell) and cxil1015922 r136 (too few crystals per run for a merge) are smoke tests:
  their DAGs stop at the concatenated stream, and they pass when the workflow completes.
