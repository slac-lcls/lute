"""LUTE task-parameters model for the GLINT GPU indexer -- a drop-in alternative to CrystFELIndexer
in the SFX DAG:  PeakFinderSFX -> [IndexGLINT] -> StreamFileConcatenator -> PartialatorMerger.
(PeakFinderSFX is optional: set `images` and GLINT peak-finds the raw .cxi on the GPU itself.)

MERGEABILITY: the default GLINT stream is ORIENTATION-ONLY -- every reflection carries placeholder
I=0/sigma=0. To merge you must pick one of `integrate: true` (GLINT predicts and box-integrates its
own reflections, writing real I/sigma) or the `tofile` -> indexamajig handoff. Feeding the default
stream straight to partialator merges zeros.

Why GLINT in LUTE: the CrystFEL builds in /sdf/group/lcls/ds/tools/crystfel (0.10.2, LUTE's default,
to 0.13.0) are compiled without FFBIDX; CrystFEL's GPU fast-feedback indexer is only in the separate
build under /sdf/group/lcls/ds/tools/crystfel-fast-feedback-indexer. GLINT adds GPU blind indexing
with cross-frame consensus, and emits the same CrystFEL `.stream` that ConcatenateStreamFiles /
partialator already consume. For the best MERGE, set `tofile` (GLINT hands
CrystFEL the refined-merge solution file).

The Executor is `GLINTIndexer` in `lute/managed_tasks.py`. GLINT itself is not bundled with LUTE, so
the `executable` field is required: it names a GLINT checkout's `lute/glint_launch.sh`, which
activates a torch environment and runs the GLINT CLI.
